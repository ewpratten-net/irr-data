# AS398057 Network Tools

This repository contains a collection of tools and scripts used to help manage the core network infrastructure that powers my projects.

## Repository Contents

Inside this repository, you'll find a few loosely related subprojects:

- `/birdgen`: A Python tool that can completely auto-configure my routers from just an `aut-num` object
- `/irr`: A local copy of my ALTDB IRR objects
- `/router-config`: Various things that need to be deployed to routers
- `/scripts`: Meta scripts for managing things
